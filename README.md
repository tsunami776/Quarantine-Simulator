# Quarantine-Simulator
Unity editor version 2020.3.26.f1
Android build

Our goal of the project is to create an experience of being quarantined during the pandemic. Being quarantined is stressful, people have to deal with both physical and mental health issues. When people stay indoors, they have to do everything in their apartment including ordering food, social interaction etc. The user experience we are aiming for in the end is to have users manage a certain budget maintaining both physical and mental health indoors. User can interact with various objects in our project like phone, food and bed etc. Potential interaction may be added in the future like playing mini games in virtual reality.

The motivation for our project is obvious because of the covid pandemic. We spent more time than ever indoors. These two years our lifestyle changed because of the pandemic. So we plan to recreate this experience through virtual reality.
