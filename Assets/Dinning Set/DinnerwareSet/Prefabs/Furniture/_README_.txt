For table cloth customization check the materials inside the "Cloth Materials" folder.

The "Cloth" material allows you to pick your own color for the cloth, which will also
change the color of any patterns in the "Detail Albedo x2" slot of the material.

The "Cloth Colored Pattern" is for use with patterns that aren't grayscale.  These
patterns would still be placed in the "Detail Albedo x2" slot, however it's
recommended the base color remains the same so that the pattern you use is
unaltered.  The original color is 787878FF in case you need to change it back.
